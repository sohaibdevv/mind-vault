# Mind Vault ‚è≥

## Project Overview

This project was created as a capstone for the Microsoft Copilot for Software Development Specialization. It demonstrates my ability to integrate AI tools into the software development workflow.

Building "Mind Vault" gave me valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of AI. It reinforced the importance of human intelligence and critical thinking when working with AI-generated content. Human oversight remains essential for solving complex development challenges.
